# A per-harness runner image (#306, #476): the coding harness plus what a run needs on a
# small checkout — git, python3, curl, gh, ripgrep, and tools to read a PDF. The launcher (bin/bot, on the
# host) runs the harness inside this image with the bot's checkout and session volume mounted and
# the bot's env file passed in (#477); the image carries no board files and no tokens. One
# image per harness, selected by the HARNESS build arg. Built for amd64 and arm64.
#
#   docker build --build-arg HARNESS=claude -f deploy/harness.Dockerfile -t bot_board-harness-claude .
#
# Node 22 is the floor claude-code and copilot ask for; codex and opencode run under it too.
FROM node:22-bookworm-slim

# What a harness run shells out to. ripgrep: claude-code uses it; the others tolerate it.
# gh: git operations and the github-lifecycle skill. curl stays: harnesses and checks fetch.
# File tools, so a bot can read what a person attaches: poppler-utils (pdftotext, pdfinfo, pdftoppm)
# for a PDF with text, tesseract-ocr (English) for one that is only an image, unzip and file.
