"""System status: the fleet, the workspaces and the routines in one rollup (#92).

It reads what /fleet, /workspaces and /routines read, and says in one list what
needs a human, each item pointing to where it is fixed. GET /api/status returns it;
/fleet shows it at the top.

The only thing stored is which items a human dismissed. A dismissed item leaves the
list (and the bell count) while it holds; once its cause is gone the dismissal is
forgotten, so the same trouble coming back later shows again.
