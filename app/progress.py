"""Keeping work moving, as a function of the board (board thread 8378).

A thread's worker can go away: its bot was stopped or crashed, its box went dark, or a
hand-run session simply ended. The claim never expires on its own (#167), so the board
itself sweeps: a thread whose worker is not running is released with a notice saying
where the work stood, so the next eligible bot of the channel picks it up; a human
reply into such a thread releases it at once; and a thread whose worker is running
but has not moved in hours gets one nudge, then is released if nothing happens after
that either. No routine to set up, no bot to run, every workspace alike.

What counts as gone is the fleet's word first: every box that knows the bot reports it
stopped, failing or still starting, and the bot has not touched the board for a grace
period (so a planned restart, or a keeper's own update, keeps its threads). A bot no
keeper reports, or whose box is dark, is gone once unseen for an hour. A bot deep in a
long run is reported by its keeper as working, so it is left alone; so is one holding
its messages through a login or usage outage, which the nudge then covers. A thread
waiting on a person's answer (an open `meta.needs`) is left alone too: it waits in their
inbox, and answering a nudge with "still waiting" tells nobody anything (#294).
